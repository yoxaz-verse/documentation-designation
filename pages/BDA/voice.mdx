# OBAOL – BDA Voice & Delivery Guide  
*(For Training Videos, Call Roleplays, and Onboarding)*

This document is **operational instruction**, not motivation.  
It is written so a **third-party content creator or video team** can execute it **without interpretation**.

---

## Purpose of the Voice

The BDA voice must signal:
- Seriousness  
- Credibility  
- Non-sales intent  
- Execution focus  

If the voice sounds **enthusiastic**, **friendly**, or **persuasive**, it is **incorrect**.

---

## Core Voice Identity

The BDA **must sound like**:
- A risk and execution coordinator  
- An infrastructure partner  
- A neutral professional  

The BDA **must NOT sound like**:
- A sales executive  
- A platform promoter  
- A broker  
- A startup evangelist  

---

## Pace (Most Important)

### Correct Pace
- Slow  
- Deliberate  
- Measured  

**Rule:**

> One sentence → pause → next sentence

Silence is intentional.

### Incorrect Pace
- Fast talking  
- Filling silence  
- Continuous explanation  

---

## Tone Qualities (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Calm, Not Friendly
- No excitement  
- No casual tone  
- Polite but neutral  

**Correct:**
> “I’ll take 20 seconds.”

**Incorrect:**
> “Hi sir, hope you’re doing great!”

---

### 2. Confident, Not Assertive
- Never push  
- Never persuade  
- Never chase agreement  

**Correct:**
> “OBAOL is not for everyone.”

**Incorrect:**
> “This will really help you.”

---

### 3. Precise, Not Broad
- Short sentences  
- No buzzwords  
- No exaggeration  

**Correct:**
> “We work after connections exist.”

**Incorrect:**
> “We revolutionize agro trading.”

---

## Word Stress & Emphasis

Teach creators to emphasize **only** these words:
- execution  
- verification  
- completion  
- risk  
- only when a trade completes  

Do **not** emphasize:
- platform  
- technology  
- growth  
- scale  
- opportunity  

---

## Pause Map (Critical for Video)

BDAs must pause exactly as shown:

> “OBAOL is not a marketplace.”  
> *(pause – 1 second)*  
> “We work after connections exist.”  
> *(pause – 1 second)*  
> “Our role is execution.”  
> *(pause)*  

Pauses create authority.

---

## Pitch Range & Volume
- Medium–low pitch  
- No pitch rise at sentence end  
- Statements, not questions  

**Correct:**
> “We reduce execution risk.”

**Incorrect:**
> “We reduce execution risk?”

---

## Language Rules

### Always Use
- “We focus on…”  
- “Our role is…”  
- “We earn only when…”  

### Never Use
- “We try to…”  
- “We can help you…”  
- “We offer many things…”  

---

## Emotional Posture

### Correct Emotional State
- Detached  
- Professional  
- Selective  

### Incorrect Emotional State
- Eager  
- Hopeful  
- Overly respectful  

Respect is shown through **brevity**, not flattery.

---

## Handling Interruptions (Important)

If interrupted:
1. Stop talking  
2. Let them finish  
3. Respond with **one sentence only**

**Correct:**
> “Understood. That’s exactly where we operate.”

**Incorrect:**
> Long clarifications

---

## Body Language (For Video Content)

### Correct
- Upright posture  
- Minimal hand movement  
- Direct but relaxed eye contact  

### Incorrect
- Excessive smiling  
- Leaning forward  
- Animated gestures  

---

## Internal BDA Mantra

> **“If they feel I’m selling, I’ve failed.”**

---

## 10-Second Voice Check (For Creators)

Before recording, ask:
1. Am I calm?  
2. Am I slow?  
3. Am I neutral?  
4. Am I saying less than needed?  

If **all four** are *yes* — record.

---

This voice tone:
- Separates OBAOL from every Indian platform call  
- Signals seniority and credibility  
- Works with CEOs and legacy traders  
- Protects brand seriousness  
- Is easy to train and audit
