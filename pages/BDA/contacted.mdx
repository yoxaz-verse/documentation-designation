# OBAOL – “You Already Contacted Me” Handling Playbook  
*(Indian Market – CEO / Founder / Senior Trader Calls)*

This is a **locked response playbook** for repeat-contact situations.  
It is written **exactly how BDAs should speak** — not marketing language.

This must be handled **calmly**, **without defensiveness**, and **without making OBAOL look disorganized**.

---

## First Rule (Non-Negotiable)

**Never deny. Never argue. Never explain history.**

**Accept → clarify purpose → move forward.**

---

## Universal Acknowledgement (Always First)

**Word-for-word:**

> “Yes, that’s right.  
> Thanks for remembering.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

This immediately:
- Disarms irritation  
- Shows respect  
- Avoids sounding confused  

---

## Scenario 1  
### “Yes, you contacted me earlier” *(Neutral / Calm)*

**Response:**

> “Just to give you context —  
> earlier we introduced OBAOL at a high level.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

Then:

> “Right now, we’re organizing relationships properly, so we’re checking whether it makes sense to assign a Relationship Partner going forward.”

**Purpose:**  
Reframes the call as **process maturity**, not repetition.

---

## Scenario 2  
### “Yes, I already shared details / spoke earlier” *(Positive)*

**Response:**

> “That’s helpful. Thank you.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

Then:

> “This call is only to confirm —  
> whether it makes sense to keep a single relationship point for you instead of multiple follow-ups.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

Then ask:

> “Are you currently active in trade or sourcing decisions?”

- **If yes** → RP handoff  
- **If no** → clean exit  

---

## Scenario 3  
### “You people already called, nothing happened” *(Mildly Negative)*

**Response (Very Important):**

> “Understood.  
> That’s exactly what we’re trying to avoid.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

Then:

> “We don’t want repeated or random calls.  
> That’s why we now assign one Relationship Partner only when it makes sense.”

Then ask:

> “Would it be okay if I check whether this is relevant now?”

**Effect:**  
Turns irritation into **process improvement**.

---

## Scenario 4  
### “I don’t remember / maybe / long time back”

**Response:**

> “No worries at all.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

Then:

> “In short — OBAOL works as an extension of your sales and execution team, helping identify genuine opportunities and ensuring deals close safely.”

Then **stop** and check interest.

---

## Scenario 5  
### “Yes, I already know about OBAOL” *(Very Positive)*

**Response:**

> “That’s great.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

Then:

> “This call is only to confirm whether it makes sense to move forward with a dedicated Relationship Partner, so conversations stay relevant and minimal.”

Then ask:

> “Would that be useful for you?”

---

## Scenario 6  
### “You already called, I’m not interested” *(Hard Negative)*

**Response (Clean Exit):**

> “Understood.  
> Thank you for being clear.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

> “I won’t take more of your time.”

**End call immediately.**

Do **not** defend.  
Do **not** pitch.

---

## What BDAs Must Never Say in This Situation

❌ “No, we didn’t call you”  
❌ “Maybe someone else called”  
❌ “You must be mistaken”  
❌ “We are calling again because…”  
❌ “Let me explain again”  

Any of these **destroy trust**.

---

## Internal BDA Rule (Very Important)

**Repeat calls must sound like progress, not repetition.**

You are not *following up*.  
You are **formalizing the relationship**.

---

## One-Line Internal Memory Aid

> **“Earlier = introduction.  
> Now = relationship clarity.”**

Train BDAs to remember this.

---

## Final CMO Verdict

This handling:
- Respects senior people’s memory  
- Avoids embarrassment on both sides  
- Makes OBAOL look organized, not spammy  
- Justifies re-contact without pressure  
- Smoothly enables RP handoff  

You now have full coverage for:
- First contact  
- Repeat contact  
- Forgotten contact  
- Positive memory  
- Negative memory
