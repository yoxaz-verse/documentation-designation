# OBAOL – First 10 Seconds + Rescheduling (Final SOP)

This is a **locked, operational script + instruction set**.  
BDAs should **not improvise**. They should **follow this exactly**.

This SOP removes thinking in the moment and ensures calm, senior-market handling.

---

## Part 1: First 10 Seconds (Always the Same)

### Word-for-Word Beginning Line

> “Good morning.  
> This is **[Name]** calling from **OBAOL**.  
> We work as an extension of your sales and execution team, helping identify genuine trade opportunities and ensuring deals close safely.  
> I’ll take 20 seconds.”

**Stop talking. Pause.**

### Why This Is Locked
- Establishes identity  
- Sets senior tone  
- Explains role (sales + execution)  
- Respects time  
- Does **not** sound like a platform or broker  

**BDAs must not add or modify anything here.**

---

## Part 2: If They Say “I’m Busy / Call Later”

This is where most BDAs fail.

Do **not** say “Okay, I’ll call later” without clarity.

### Step 1: Acknowledge (One Line)

> “Understood.”

### Step 2: Take Control of Time (Non-Negotiable)

**Word-for-word:**

> “What would be a better time today or tomorrow?”

⏸️ *Pause and wait.*

---

## Part 3: Lock the Callback Time (Very Important)

### If They Give a Time  
*(Example: “Call after 4”)*

**Response:**

> “Perfect.  
> I’ll call you today at **4:15**.”

Then immediately:

> “Thank you.”

**End call.**

**Rules:**
- Always repeat the **exact time**
- Never say “I’ll try” or “maybe”

---

## Part 4: If They Say “Call Anytime / Later”

This is vague. You must narrow it.

**Response:**

> “Sure.  
> Would later today around **4** work, or **tomorrow morning**?”

Let them choose.

Then lock it:

> “Great. I’ll call you at **[time]**.”

---

## Part 5: If They Say “Send Message / WhatsApp”

**Response:**

> “Sure.  
> I’ll send a short note now, and I’ll call you **tomorrow at [time]** to see if it’s relevant.”

This keeps momentum without pressure.

---

## Part 6: If They Do Not Give Any Time

**Response (Final Attempt):**

> “No problem.  
> I’ll send a brief note, and if it’s relevant we can connect later.”

**End call.**

Do **not** chase further.

---

## Part 7: Internal BDA Callback Rules (Very Important)

Train this strictly:

1. Never call **earlier** than the promised time  
2. Call within **±5 minutes** of the committed time  
3. If you miss the time → **do not call again the same day**  
4. If they don’t answer at callback → send **one short WhatsApp only**

### Example WhatsApp

> “Hi, this is **[Name]** from **OBAOL**.  
> Tried calling as discussed. No urgency — we can connect when convenient.”

No follow-up calls the same day.

---

## Part 8: What BDAs Must Never Say During Rescheduling

❌ “I’ll keep calling”  
❌ “I’ll try again later”  
❌ “Please pick up”  
❌ “Just one minute”  

These reduce respect and credibility.

---

## Internal BDA Memory Line

> **“We don’t chase time.  
> We agree on time.”**

---

## Complete Flow Summary (For Training Slide)

1. Say the 10-second intro  
2. Pause  
3. If busy → ask for exact time  
4. Repeat the time  
5. Call exactly then  
6. One attempt only  

---

## Final CMO Verdict

This structure:
- Removes confusion for BDAs  
- Makes OBAOL sound organized and senior  
- Prevents random follow-ups  
- Increases callback pickup rate  
- Fits Indian business culture perfectly  

You now have a **complete beginning + rescheduling SOP**.
