# OBAOL – Call Ending Script (RP Handoff Version)

This is the **final operational ending** for BDA calls.  
It is designed to achieve **two goals simultaneously**:

1. Qualify whether the prospect is suitable for a **Relationship Partner (RP)**  
2. Hand off ownership smoothly from **BDA → RP** without sounding pushy or salesy  

This ending must be used **only after**:
- The prospect listened  
- Did not reject outright  
- Sounds neutral to mildly interested  

---

## Step 1: Qualification Check (Very Short)

**Word-for-word:**

> “Before we take this forward, just to be clear —  
> do you actively handle trades or sourcing decisions?”

⏸️ *Pause.*

**Why this matters:**
- Filters time-wasters  
- Respects seniority  
- Positions the RP as a valuable resource  

---

## Step 2: Frame the RP (Do Not Introduce as Sales)

**Word-for-word:**

> “In that case, what we usually do is assign a Relationship Partner.”

⏸️ *Pause.*

Then immediately clarify:

> “Their role is not sales.  
> They understand your trade flow, stay in touch, and see where OBAOL can actually add value.”

This clarification is **non-negotiable**.

---

## Step 3: Permission-Based Handoff (Critical)

**Word-for-word:**

> “Would it make sense for me to connect you with them for a short introductory conversation?”

⏸️ *Pause and wait for the answer.*

This keeps:
- Control with the prospect  
- RP positioned as support, not pressure  

---

## Step 4: If They Say Yes

**Response:**

> “Perfect.  
> I’ll have them reach out with context, so you don’t have to repeat anything.”

Then:

> “Thank you for your time.”

**End call.**

---

## Step 5: If They Say Maybe / Later

**Response:**

> “No problem at all.  
> I’ll share a short note first.  
> If it feels relevant, we can connect you later.”

Then:

> “Thank you for your time.”

**End call.**

---

## Step 6: If They Say No

**Response (Very Important):**

> “Understood.  
> Thanks for the clarity.  
> I won’t take more of your time.”

**End call immediately.**

This preserves brand dignity.

## What BDAs Must Never Say About RP

❌ “Our sales person will call you”  
❌ “Our executive will follow up”  
❌ “Someone will convince you”  
❌ “They will explain everything”  

The RP must always be framed as:
- Relationship  
- Context  
- Ongoing understanding  
- Value discovery  

---

## Internal Positioning Line (For BDAs to Remember)

> **“BDAs open the door.  
> RPs build the corridor.”**

This helps teams respect boundaries.

---

## Ideal Call Flow Summary

1. 10-second intro  
2. 20-second positioning  
3. Interest check  
4. RP qualification + permission  
5. Clean exit  

**Total time:** 60–90 seconds
