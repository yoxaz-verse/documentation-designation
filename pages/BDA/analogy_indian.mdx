# OBAOL – Traditional Indian Analogies (Corrected & Aligned)

These are **spoken-English explanations**, exactly how a **BDA should say them** in real conversations.  
They reflect **both realities** of OBAOL:

- Finding opportunities (sales / sourcing)  
- Executing safely (verification + closure)

## 1. Trusted Sales Boy / Field Staff Analogy (Very Accurate)

**How BDAs should say it:**

> “Every good trader has one trusted sales boy or field staff.”

⏸️ Pause.

> “He looks for business, talks to people, brings opportunities.”

> “But more importantly, he checks seriousness, follows up, and makes sure the deal actually happens.”

⏸️ Pause.

> “OBAOL works like that — but as a system and a team, not just one person.”

**Why this works:**
- Covers sales **and** execution  
- Very Indian  
- No downgrading of anyone  
- Shows continuity, not replacement

## 2. Commission Agent + Supervisor Combination (Very Real)

**How to say it:**

⏸️ Pause.

> “Good traders don’t depend only on introductions.”

> “They keep someone to search the market, filter people, and supervise execution.”

⏸️ Pause.

## What BDAs Must Still Avoid

Even with this corrected framing, **never say**:

❌ “We guarantee buyers”  
❌ “We force deals”  
❌ “We control pricing”  
❌ “We are brokers”  

**Always use words like:**
- Search  
- Identify  
- Filter  
- Coordinate  
- Support execution

## Internal BDA Rule (Updated)

> **“We are not just after the deal.  
> We are responsible for how the deal finishes.”**

This keeps expectations correct — internally and externally.

## Final CMO Verdict

This corrected framing:
- Reflects the **true operating model**
- Builds trust with **traditional traders**
- Explains sales involvement **without broker stigma**
- Sounds familiar, not tech-heavy
- Positions OBAOL as **serious business support**
