# 💼 OBAOL Sales Commission Ecosystem

> “A transparent, performance-driven reward system built entirely within the 30% profit pool.”

---

## 🔹 1. Overview

At **OBAOL**, every sale creates value for the company and the team who contributed — from the person who closed the deal to the mentors and support roles.

We follow **one simple rule**:

> 💰 **30% of the company’s net profit** from each verified deal forms the **Sales Commission Pool**.

All rewards, commissions, and gamified incentives come **only from this 30% pool**, ensuring fairness, transparency, and sustainability.

---

## 🔹 2. When Commissions are Paid

Commissions are released **only after**:

- Product is loaded or dispatched
- Transaction and payment are verified
- Final profit is confirmed

> ⚠️ POs, inquiries, or partial deals do not trigger any payout.

## 🔹 4. Deal Closer (DC)

The **Deal Closer** is the key performer who successfully finalizes the transaction.

- Receives **40% of the 30% pool**
- Can also be an RP, BDA, or another salesperson depending on who closes the deal

> Example:  
> Net profit = ₹100,000 → 30% pool = ₹30,000 → Deal Closer gets ₹12,000

## 🔹 5. Layer Rewards (30% of Pool)

Mentorship and guidance are rewarded through **fixed layers** and **dynamic extended layers**.

### Fixed Layers (L1 → L3)

| Layer  | % of 30% Pool | Description                              |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **L1** | 12%           | Direct mentor of the closer              |
| **L2** | 8%            | Senior mentor / upline                   |
| **L3** | 10%           | Team/regional mentor (max 5% per person) |

### Dynamic Layers (L3+)

- 10% of the 30% pool is reserved for **all layers beyond L3**
- Divided equally among all extended layers
- Maximum per layer = 3%
- If there are 10+ layers, the 10% pool is split evenly
- Vacant layers → share reserved by OBAOL for internal incentives
